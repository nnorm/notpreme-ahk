# NotPreme-AHK
A short [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script designed to replace ["Preme for Windows"](http://www.premeforwindows.com/) for the use I make of it.  
The only reason I did that is that I wanted a more minimal software to do these things and not depend on Preme anymore since it seems to be mostly abandoned.   
It was also the opportunity to learn how to make AHK scripts.  
You can launch it as you start Windows following [these steps](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup).

## Features
+ Mouse scroll up/down on the taskbar to change volume.
+ Mouse scroll down on window title bar to minimize.
